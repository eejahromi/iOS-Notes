C-Library for managing different threads using queues and blocks

->declaring a new queue
dispatch_queue_t queue;

//two popular types of queues
1.serial: makes sure that the operations are happening in order and coming back in order
dispatch_queue_create("reverseDNSstringByConvention",DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL);

2.concurrent: operations are happening simultaneously and coming back as soon as finishing
dispatch_get_global_queue(GLOBAL_QUEUE_PRIORITY,0);

-four types of queues
GLOBAL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH
GLOBAL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
GLOBAL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW
GLOBAL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND // lowest priority

adding tasks to a background queue
dispatch_async(queueName,^{ codeBlock });

**All UI related stuff should be run on the main queue
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(),^{ codeBlock });
