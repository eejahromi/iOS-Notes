-For uploading files
Start uploading file before user presses upload to get a head start

-Object initialization performance
If an object creation for a task takes a while do it earlier when you anticipate user will try to do that task
Example: Creating new conversation in a chat app while the user is idle in the chat listView

-Database initialization
if database initialization is affecting performance, we can ship the app with an initialized DB in the bundle
