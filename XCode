A collection of useful tips, tricks and shortcut in XCode

-Open quickly: good for jumping in between files or even searching for method names
command + shift + o

-Jump to definition: right click on a method name in a .h file to jump to the implementation

-Related items menu
subclasses and superclasses: useful for file hierarchy and understanding the project
caller and callee for methods

-debugging
summary format edit: changing summary format of the variables in debugging area
right click on variable > edit summary format > type in a valid message
i.e {$VAR.textLabel.text};s

options for what to show:
n - variable name
s - summary
t - type
v - value

-watch
setting up watch for a certain variables to see when it changes


-code commenting keywords
#pragma mark - 
//FIXME:
//TODO:
//MARK:

-version control in command line (can't do in XCode)
git reset --hard HEAD // revert
git tag v1.0 // tagging
git stash // put all the changes since last commit in a stack
git stash drop // forget the last stash (if you stash twice, you have to drop twice)
git mergetool -t opendiff // for merge conflicts

-breakpoints tips
General breakpoints
-use the navigator
CMD + backslash for adding/deleting breakpoints
-can group or share breakpoints

Logging breakpoints
Edit breakpoint > conditions/actions/commands
Executing scripts

Exception breakpoint 
(when we end up in main.m without useful info)
exception navigator > add exception point > add action
actions: 
po $eax (32 bit simulator) $rax (64 bit) $r0 (device)
bt (backtrace)

Symbolic breakpoint
for ignoring cases like skipping iterations of loops and adding more action

-Instruments
different templates for different purposes
option-click on timeline when recording, we can put little markers (bookmark time)
