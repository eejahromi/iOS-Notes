//Types of extensions:
Today
Share
Action
Photo Editing
Finder Sync
Document Provider
Custom keyboard

Extension communication:
Containing app - the app with the extension (provider)
Host app       - the app in which you may use the extension in
App Extension

There is no direct connection between the containing app and the app extension.
The host app sends a request to the app extension
The app extension will send a response to the request by host app

Indirect extension and containing app communication:
we can use share groups to communicate between the two
we turn on share groups in the project settings with the same reverse domain identifiers
then we can use userDefaults to store/retreive information.
