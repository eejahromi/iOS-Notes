Local Notifications

NOTE: Local notifications only fire when application is in the background, if we want to get a message while app is in 
foreground the we have to show an alert

also in AppDelegate we can use the method application:didReceiveLocalNotification: to know when a notification fires globally

-pre iOS 10
UILocalNotification class
UILocalNotification *notification = [[UILocalNotification alloc]init];
notification.alertTitle = @"Reminder";
notification.alertBody = @"Buy milk";
notification.fireDate = aFutureDate;
notification.repeatInterval = NSCalendarUnitDay; // repeat daily
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] scheduleLocalNotification:notification];
