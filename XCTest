assertion (rules)
unit test method
unit class
unit test bundle

unit test methods
setup: set it up, create and provide tools
-setup gets called for every test method

teardown: clean up after, setting variables to original
-teardown gets called after every test method

if we want these to only run once, we add plus to the beginning of the method and don't call super

test: test itself, based on use case

test methods
should start with the word test
should have void for return type

all assertions(facts):
return void
generate some kind of failure
take in...format parameter

Assertion types:

XCTAssertNil(a1,format);
XCTAssertNotNil(a1,format);
//checks for nil values passing in and out of the functions

XCTAssertTrue(expression,format); // ex, XCTAssertTrue(1 + 1 == 2,@"");
XCTAssertFalse(expression,format);
// checks for true and false expressions
