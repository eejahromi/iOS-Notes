Loop
  -Profile with Instruments

General Instruments tips:
use shift + drag and Option + drag to see different intervals of the recording

Useful instruments:
-TimeProfiler:
For issues like lagging tableview or low frame rates in a graphics heavy app

>>Useful configurations:
frame rate: for profiling intervals. The lower, the more data samples available to see i.e 10ms (every 10 ms)
record waiting threads: additionally record samples for threads waiting in the background (helps with waiting threads i.e locks)

->Pay attention to:
Call tree view: sample datas in a tree structure
Tip:Option + -> toexpand the entire tree
-Most amount of time spent in a function (follow the big number down the tree)
-DetailView (On the right): Heaviest stack trace functions
(Double click to go to source code)
-Check out thread view to see what each thread is doing
-if we took samples of idle threads click on those to see what the idle thread is doing

CPU usage: how much CPU is being used at any given moment
-also CPU view will show you the activity of each core at a given moment

-for memory issues: Allocation, Leaks, Zombies
