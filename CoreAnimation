CoreAnimation is a graphics rendering and animation infrastructure on iOS and macOS
It works on the layer property of views and the work is done on the GPU

-CALayer
every view is backed by a CALayer to get the bitmap informaiton of that view
--useful properties
* borderRadius and other border related properties
* shadowRadius and other shadow related properties
* anchorPoint and anchorPointZ
* mask

->subclasses
CAGradientLayer: built in gradient layer that makes gradients easy to achieve compared to CoreGraphics
steps to ceate gradientLayer
-create CAGradientLayer
-set frame
-set colors array
-add layer to view


NOTE: CALayer does not recognize touch

Rendering behaviors (for performance)
-drawsAsynchronously: when true, this layer will be drawn asynchronously (for layers that get redrawn a lot)
-shouldRasterize: when true, this layer only gets drawn once
NOTE: Normaly only one of these should be configured by the developer, if needed

-Removing implicit animation from layer
[CATransaction begin];
[CATransaction setDisableActions:YES];
// configurations with layer
[CATransaction commit];
