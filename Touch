->Hit Test
when the user touches the screen, iOS looks for the view that was touched and that becomes the hit test view

methods
UIWindow sendEvent
(UIView *)hitTest:withEvent:
(BOOL) pointInside:withEvent:

UIWindow sendEvent fires first thing after touch
then point inside will fire for a view to see if the touch occured inside that view
if NO, hit test skips that view
if YES, then hitTest will fire
this repeats until hitTest is detected
