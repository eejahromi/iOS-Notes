viewControllerLifeCycle

-viewDidLoad: Great for init stuff, except for geometry stuff because the bounds has already been set. 
Only called once so put things that you want to load only once.

-viewWillAppear: good for geometry stuff but not for stuff you only want to load once because viewWillAppear could be called more than once.

-viewWillDisappear: free up stuff and stop things like animations.
