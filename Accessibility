Accessibility Attributes

-Label: Way to identify the accessible element i.e "Back Button"
-Traits: Elements state, behavior or usage i.e "is selected" for UIButton
-Hint: describes what element completes i.e "Shows product details"
-Frame: The frame of the element within the screen
-Value: value of the element i.e "54 out of 100" for UISlider


-Accessibility identifier vs Accessibility label
Accessibility identifier is for testing where as Accessibility label is what is read out loud to the user by voice over

// marking something as accessibility element
descriptionLabel.isAccessibilityElement = YES;
NOTE: In UIKit most of the elements are already set to YES except for labels
Also if this is set to YES then it will be read as a seperate accebility in voice over so we can use this trick to make it one:
// example: A tableViewCell containing a label
set the flag to NO
descriptionLabel.isAccessibilityElement = NO;
descriptionLabel.accessibilityLabel = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Unchecked %@",descriptionLabel.text];
