Build Process

-Pre-compilation
Before compilation begins, target dependencies are put together by XCode build tools.

-Compilation
From a higher level, the compiler does a couple of things with our Objc code. First it converts Objc to lower level code and 
second it analyzes code to make sure we didn't make any obvious mistakes.

--Compiler
Clang is the compiler for Objc. Which is the front-end to Apple's LLVM.
Clang takes the Objc code, analyzes it and then it transforms it to low-level representation that resembles assembly code.
LLVM takes those instructions and turns it into native byte code for the target platform.

Useful Command: clang -ccc-print-phases hello.m // shows the different phases clang goes through for compiling source file
Typical phases include: Preprocessor, compiler, assembler, linker
