->two types of animation

presentation layer -> use view animations
model layer -> use CABasicAnimation

-iOS4+ use animation blocks for view based animation
-for animating layers we use CABasicAnimation object

CAKeyframeAnimation *bounceAnimation = [CAKeyframeAnimation
animationWithKeyPath:@"transform.scale"];
bounceAnimation.duration = 0.4;
bounceAnimation.delegate = self;
bounceAnimation.values = @[ @0.7, @1.2, @0.9, @1.0 ];
bounceAnimation.keyTimes = @[ @0.0, @0.334, @0.666, @1.0 ];
bounceAnimation.timingFunctions = @[
[CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut],
[CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut],
[CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut]
  ];
[self.view.layer addAnimation:bounceAnimation forKey:@"bounceAnimation"];

CABasicAnimation

CABasicAnimation *fadeAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"opacity"];
fadeAnimation.fromValue = @0.0f;
fadeAnimation.toValue = @1.0f;
fadeAnimation.duration = 0.2;
[_gradientView.layer addAnimation:fadeAnimation forKey:@"fadeAnimation"];
